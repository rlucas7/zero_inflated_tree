To understand the properties of the tree method we devised two simple simulation studies. The first mimics the simulation done by \textbf{add cite of Lee}. The second simulation studies the usage of a continuous covariate. The aim of this section is to convince the reader of the benefit of using either \ZIP or \ZINB models for Bayesian decision trees. 

\subsection{A Simple Simulation}

In this section we mimic the simulation done in Lee \cite{lee2006decision}.
We briefly describe the simulation study here but further details can be found in their paper. 

We simulate a zero-inflated Poisson distribution with two different values for the rate parameter, $lambda$ and $\lambda+\epsilon$ for various values of $\epsilon$. Whether the rate is the smaller of the two values is determined by whether $x_1 \in \{0,1\}$. The smaller rate is smaller when $x_1=0$. An additional noise variable is simulated with $x_2 \in \{0,1\}$. We simulate $m=300$ data points from this distribution. We then fit trees to this data using the Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson model discussed in Section \ref{sec:model_details}. 

Table \ref{tab:simul_results} gives the details from the result of the simulation. 
 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Simulation from the '06 ZIP tree paper. 
\item Simulation using a continuous variate too? 
\end{enumerate}
