To understand the properties of the tree method we devised two simple simulation studies. The first mimics the simulation done by \textbf{add cite of Lee}. The second simulation studies the usage of a continuous covariate. The aim of this section is to convince the reader of the benefit of using either \ZIP or \ZINB models for Bayesian decision trees. 

\subsection{A Simple Simulation}

In this section we mimic the simulation done in Lee \cite{}. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Simulation from the '06 ZIP tree paper. 
\item Simulation using a continuous variate too? 
\end{enumerate}
