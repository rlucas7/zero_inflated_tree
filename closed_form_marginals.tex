 % this file contains the derivations for the marginal densities
% taken from my thesis. 

This section contains the derivations for the marginal densities for the decision trees. We derive the marginal density for the zero-inflated Poisson model and give the result for the zero-inflated negative binomial, the derivation is analogous to the approach for the zero-inflated Poisson.
